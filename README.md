Hangman is a simple game and it is designed to have the user input a random letter to match up with a random word that is generated from the established variable arrays that I have programmed into it. My intention with the project was to make it more interactive with video clips, sound effects and a stylized layout but unfortunately I was unable to complete that task. 

Thats it really. Since my game is not interactive, explaining it further may be just moot.


















Personal note: I really struggled on this assignment. I have been following tutorials online, breaking concepts down line by line and I still have a difficult time understanding the syntax. I struggle with the basic concepts of what I'm trying to accomplish as well as the order of operations.
